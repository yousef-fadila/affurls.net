Object
============
Prior to introducing the affurls.net, I used to publish the affiliate links directly on my blogs/online marketing channels, The main pain for me was that once the offer is expired and in many cases it expires in less than one month, I start loosing traffic as the link become invalid.

This software has a background process to check every day if the link is valid or not, if not it will replace the target with new offer so no traffic will be lost. 


Demo
==================
The software is installed in root of affurls.net, for example this shortcut 

http://www.affurls.net/cnn 

is forwarding to 
http://www.cnn.com
